# webhooks
Jupyter notebooks for use in ArcGIS Notebook server to act as webhook receivers.

The webhook payloads are not easy to discern from the documentation. These notebooks parse the output into variables that can be used to build automated workflows when triggered by a webhook event.

Useful documentation:

* [Payloads](https://enterprise.arcgis.com/en/portal/latest/administer/windows/webhook-payloads.htm)
* [Create Webhook]("https://developers.arcgis.com/rest/users-groups-and-items/create-webhooks.htm")
* [Automate a notebook using webhooks]("https://enterprise.arcgis.com/en/notebook/latest/administer/linux/automate-notebook-execution.htm#ESRI_SECTION1_E61B62B25F394778BCE814AA1298083C")
